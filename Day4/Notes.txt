Main problem is inversion of control 
we are relying on createOrder api to call proceedToPaymeny api when it is done creating an order
isnt it risky  ? We are trusting some other api to call our callback correctly


Problems with this code:

1. Poor Readability: The nested structure makes code hard to read and maintain
2.Error Handling: Difficult to implement proper error handling for each callback
3. Inversion of Control: You're trusting the APIs to call your callbacks correctly
4. Debugging: Hard to debug due to multiple nested levels
